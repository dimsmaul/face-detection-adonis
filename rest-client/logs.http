### corresponding logs will be created automatically with:
### - title: table name (attendances, permits, notifications)
### - note: action format like "1.create_attendance", "2.request_permit"

### Examples of automatic log creation:
### 1. Creating attendance -> logs.title = "attendances", logs.note = "1.create_attendance"
### 2. Requesting permit -> logs.title = "permits", logs.note = "1.request_permit"
### 3. Creating notification -> logs.title = "notifications", logs.note = "1.create_notification"
